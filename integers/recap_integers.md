### Learnings
- More of the Write Test, Code til pass, refactor process
- Integers and addition
- using different format strings (%d instead of %q for integers)
    - much like when learning C, nice similarity.
- didn't name the return variable in Add() because it is clear
    - learned comments above functions are included in godoc.
- defined a new package 'integers'
    - packages form of grouping functions
- writing Examples and running them with 'go test'
    - need a comment // Output: x for it to run in test suite
    - if example fails, build fails
- go test -v. It's verbosin' time.
